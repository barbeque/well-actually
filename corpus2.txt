Slitscan's audience is best visualized as a vicious, lazy, profoundly ignorant,
perpetually hungry organism craving the warm god-flesh of the anointed. Personally
I like to imagine something the size of a baby hippo, the color of a week-old boiled
potato, that lives by itself, in the dark, in a double-wide on the outskirts of Topeka.

It's covered with eyes and it sweats constantly.
The sweat runs into those eyes and makes them sting.
It has no mouth, Laney, no genitals, and can only express its mute extremes of murderous rage
and infantile desire by changing the channels on a universal remote.

Or by voting in presidential elections.
